# At its core, Pythonâ€™s assert statement is a debugging aid that tests a
# condition. If the assert condition is true, nothing happens, and your
# program continues to execute as normal. But if the condition evaluates to false,
# an AssertionError exception is raised with an optional error message.

# Assertions inform developers about unrecoverable errors in a program.
# They do not signal expected error conditions, like File-Not-Found errors.
# Users can take corrective actions for expected error conditions.
# Users can attempt to try again after encountering an error.
# These situations differ from unrecoverable errors identified by assertions.
# Assertions serve as internal self-checks within the code.
# They declare certain conditions as impossible; a failure indicates a bug.
# When an assertion fails, the program crashes with a specific assertion error message.
# Assertions help track down and fix bugs more easily.
# The assert statement is a debugging aid, not for handling run-time errors.
# An assertion error should indicate a bug in the program.
# Assertions help developers quickly identify the likely root cause of bugs.

# Use regular if statements for data validation instead of assertions,
# as assertions can be globally disabled with an interpreter setting (-O and -OO flags).
# Avoid using non-empty tuples in assert statements, as they always
# evaluate to true in Python, causing the assertion to never fail.
